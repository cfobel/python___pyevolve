"*We can allow satellites, planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universe, to
be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act.*"

\- **Charles R. Darwin, 1838**

Pyevolve was developed to be a *complete genetic algorithm framework written in pure python*, but since the version 0.6,
the framework is also supporting Genetic Programming, so in the near future, the framework will be more an Evolutionary
Algorithm framework than a simple GA framework.
